Hello there,as a novice rust learner,I am undertaking one of the biggest Rust Projects I have ever made:

This simple yet complex project is supposed to help me with learning:

    1. Rust.
    2. API integration in Rust.
    3. API testing with probably PostMan
    4. A web framework for Rust

Anyway enough about me,

Introducing `Kutu`(A swahili word for Rust),a password manager in Rust.

These are my deliverabled for this project:

    A. Core Functionality:

        1. Password storage: Securely store passwords, usernames, and website URLs.
        2. Password generation: Generate strong, random passwords.
        3. Password editing: Edit and update saved passwords.
        4. Multi-user: Support separate accounts for multiple users.
        5. Encryption: Encrypt passwords using industry-standard algorithms.
