Hello there,as a novice rust learner,I am undertaking one of the biggest Rust Projects I have ever made:

This simple yet complex project is supposed to help me with learning:

    1. Rust as a language.
    2. API integration in Rust.
    3. API testing with probably PostMan
    4. A web framework for Rust.

Anyway enough about me,

Introducing `Kutu`(A swahili word for Rust),a password manager written in Rust.

I am open to collaborations on this project,just fork/clone the repository and open a pull R/Q.

Also,call out my code,if it has any issues.

These are my deliverabled for this project:

    A. Core Functionality:

        1. Password storage: Securely store passwords, usernames, and website URLs.
        2. Password generation: Generate strong, random passwords.
        3. Password editing: Edit and update saved passwords.
        4. Multi-user: Support separate accounts for multiple users.
        5. Encryption: Encrypt passwords using industry-standard algorithms.

    B. Advanced Features:
        
        1. API integration: Integrate with password generators, security services, etc.
        2. Web app: Develop a user-friendly web interface for password management.
        3. Security measures: Implement two-factor authentication, master password, etc.
        4. Cloud integration: I want this web app to be idealy hosted on the cloud,
           with some cloud services here and there,most likely on AWS.

    C. Cool Suggestions/Future of this project:

        1. Integrate password auditing tools to check for weak passwords and vulnerabilities.
        2. Implement password sharing with secure one-time links for emergencies.
        3. Offer secure notes storage for additional sensitive information.
        4. Build a native app and or CLI tool for convenient access on the go.

This repo is unique to me because I have decided to split the code into multiple branches ie:
    
    1. Features(You are here,also main branch) - Contains the Readme for the main project and licenses only.
    2. Backend - Contains only the backend code.
