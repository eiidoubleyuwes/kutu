Hello there,as a novice rust learner,I am undertaking one of the biggest Rust Projects I have ever made:

This simple yet complex project is supposed to help me with learning:

    1. Rust.
    2. API integration in Rust.
    3. API testing with probably PostMan
    4. A web framework for Rust

Anyway enough about me,

Introducing Kutu(A swahili word for Rust),a password manager in Rust.
